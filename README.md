```sh
git clone https://github.com/thefirstminute/vim.git ~/.config/nvim
mkdir -p ~/.config/nvim/{pluggos,backups,swaps,undos}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xdotool
```


### some remarks
* You can copy and paste with Ctrl-c & Ctrl-v
* x deletes to the "_x register
* Y yanks till end of line, like how D and C work
* Escape also clears command text
* caps is automatically turned off when exiting insert mode


### Like To Have/Needs Work
 - want buffer numbers in tabline
 - emmet is putting the cursor in the wrong place sometimes, assume it's coc??
